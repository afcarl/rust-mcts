Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for rust 
---------------------------------------

This project is my excuse for learning rust and implementing an interesting 
and hopefully useful algorithm at the same time.

Introduction 
------------

MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm that is often employed to write 
computer agents for turn-based games such as Go, Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe etc.
